This project will explore how we can automate business processes using Selenium. Obviously writing an API to perform these tasks would be a more sensible option but development time is expensive.

When complete this project will demonstrate the automation of a process in Selenium along with leveraging AWS to scale this process using Lambda.

This simple example will be built to perform a simple task which can later be modified to allow for automated testing (both functional and load). :wq
